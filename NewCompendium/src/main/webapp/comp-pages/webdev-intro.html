				<h1 class="content-title">Introduction</h1>
				<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript is the Holy Trinity for web applications.<br>
				HTML is a markup language that forms the basic structure of the website, which consists of a head and a body and has tags like div for basic grouping, p to represent paragraphs and sentences. <br>Then we add CSS at takes those structures further and introduces a look and feel to the website; mixing in colour by changing the background or text or even the position and later allowing animations through keyframes and transitions. CSS makes the HTML look better. <br>
				Behind those two is the JavaScript which handles events such as clicks and scrolls and provides a way to connect the front-end website with say a back-end server where we can load data to and from using JavaScript. Essentially providing functionality to the looks.</p>

				<h1 class="content-title">Installation</h1>
				<p>To program in basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript all you really need is an Browser and a Text Editor, Google Chrome is a popular browser to test your Website on but also has interesting Developer Tools that provide a good amount of debugging information, it also has mobile viewport options that allow testing in an mobile environment.<br>
				However you shouldn't make it inclusive and test the website on a manner of different Browsers.<br>
				A good Text Editor on the other hand, I use Atom but Notepad++ is a good alternative.<br>
				I like to actually use Eclipse for Web Development, it gives you the option of running your website on a Server which real-time editing as well as certain operations only being able to run when the website is hosted. I use a Tomcat Server to host my website locally. Also allows the ability to implement a Java backend on the side.<br>
