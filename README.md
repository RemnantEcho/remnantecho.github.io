# New Compendium

My custom and final website for my Projects here on.
This website works best on Desktop with decent screen resolution, it does work on Mobile but is not very legible.
If I do improve Mobile support then a Overhaul will be necessary.

**Features include**
- Projects; with instructions, links to the Github page and alternative download from Google Drive, as well as a Tutorial Video.
- About Page; describes my education, hobbies and extra-curricular activities.
- Compendium; a compilation of techniques that I've used in my projects.

**Website Features**
- One-Page design
- Vertical carousel
- Light and Dark themes
- Expanding Menu items
- Curtain Animaion
- Lazy loading compendium
- Expanding Project Boxes
- Embedded Videos
- Tab Menus
